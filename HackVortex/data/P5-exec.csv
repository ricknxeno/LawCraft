It grants certain rights to Parliament to ensure its smooth functioning and protection of its members.

Clause 1: Freedom of Speech in Parliament
Freedom of Speech: Members of Parliament have the right to speak freely in Parliament. This means they can express their views on any topic without fear of legal action, but their speech is still subject to the rules of the Parliament.
However, this freedom is not absolute and is subject to the rules and standing orders (procedures) that Parliament follows. For example, there may be limits to what can be discussed or how discussions should be conducted.
Clause 2: Immunity from Legal Proceedings
Immunity from Court Action: No member of Parliament can be sued or face any legal proceedings in a court for anything they say in Parliament or for any vote they give. This means they have legal immunity for their actions within Parliament.
Publication Immunity: Similarly, if anything published by or under the authority of Parliament, such as reports, papers, or proceedings, it cannot be used against anyone in court.
Clause 3: Powers, Privileges, and Immunities Defined by Parliament
The powers and privileges of the Parliament, its members, and its committees are decided by Parliament itself through laws.
Until these laws are made, the powers and privileges are the same as they were before 1978, when a specific amendment (Forty-Fourth Amendment) came into force.
This means that the legal rights and protections for members of Parliament (such as their ability to speak freely, etc.) were established before 1978 and continue to apply unless Parliament passes new laws to change them.
Clause 4: Application to Other People
The provisions mentioned in Clauses 1, 2, and 3 (freedom of speech, immunity from legal action, and powers/privileges) apply not just to members of Parliament, but also to those who have the right to speak in Parliament or take part in parliamentary proceedings.

 (2) Subject to the provisions of Article 108 and 109, a Bill shall not be deemed to have been passed by the Houses of Parliament unless it has been agreed to by both Houses, either without amendment or with such amendments only as are agreed by both Houses
 (3) A Bill pending in Parliament shall not lapse by reason of the prorogation of the Houses
 (4) A Bill pending in the Council of States which has not been passed by the House of the People shall not lapse on a dissolution of the House of the People
 (5) A Bill which is pending in the House of the People, or which having been passed by the House of the People is pending in the council of States, shall subject to the provisions of Article 108, lapse on a dissolution of the House of the People",Article 107: Provisions as to Introduction and Passing of Bills,"This article explains how a Bill (a proposed law) is introduced and passed in Parliament. It outlines the process and conditions under which a Bill moves between the two Houses of Parliament: the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).

Clause 1: Origin of a Bill
Where a Bill Can Start: A Bill can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha. There is no rule that requires a Bill to start in one House over the other, except for Money Bills and other financial Bills, which have specific rules (mentioned in Articles 109 and 117).
Clause 2: Agreement Between Both Houses
Agreement Required for Passage: For a Bill to be passed, both Houses must agree to it. This can be with or without changes (amendments), but any amendments must be agreed upon by both Houses.
If the Lok Sabha agrees on a Bill with amendments, the Rajya Sabha must also agree on the same amendments (and vice versa). If they cannot agree, the Bill is not passed.
Money Bills (related to taxes, government spending, etc.) have separate rules.
Clause 3: Bills Not Lapsing Due to Prorogation
No Lapse During Prorogation: If a Bill is still being discussed or has not been passed by either House, it does not get canceled or ""lapse"" if the Parliament is prorogued (temporarily closed).
This ensures that the work on the Bill can continue after Parliament reopens.
Clause 4: Bills in Rajya Sabha When Lok Sabha is Dissolved
Bill Pending in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha Dissolved: If a Bill is still under discussion in the Rajya Sabha and has not yet been passed by the Lok Sabha, it does not lapse if the Lok Sabha is dissolved (disbanded).
This means the Bill can still continue its passage when the new Lok Sabha is formed.
Clause 5: Bills in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Dissolved
Bill Pending in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha and Dissolution of Lok Sabha: If a Bill is in the Lok Sabha or if it has been passed by the Lok Sabha and is still pending in the Rajya Sabha, it laps (ends) if the Lok Sabha is dissolved.
This means the Bill cannot continue unless reintroduced after the new Lok Sabha is formed.
"
108,"108. Joint sitting of both Houses in certain cases
 (1) If after a Bill has been passed by one House and transmitted to the other House
 (a) the Bill is rejected by the other House; or
 (b) the Houses have finally disagreed as to the amendments to be made in the Bill; or
 (c) more than six months elapse from the date of the reception of the Bill by the other House without the Bill being passed by it the President may, unless the Bill has lapsed by reason of a dissolution of the House of the People, notify to the Houses by message if they are sitting or by public notification if they are not sitting, his intention to summon them to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose of deliberating and voting on the Bill: Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply to a Money Bill
 (2) In reckoning any such period of six months as is referred to in clause ( 1 ), no account shall be taken of any period during which the House referred to in sub clause (c) of that clause is prorogued or adjourned for more than four consecutive days
 (3) Where the President has under clause ( 1 ) notified his intention of summoning the Houses to meet in a joint sitting, neither House shall proceed further with the Bill, but the President may at any time after the date of his notification summon the Houses to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose specified in the notification and, if he does so, the Houses shall meet accordingly
 (4) If at the joint sitting of the two Houses the Bill, with such amendments, if any, as are agreed to in joint siting, is passed by a majority of the total number of members of both Houses present and voting, it shall be deemed for the purposes of this Constitution to have been passed by both Houses: Provided that a joint sitting
 (a) if the Bill, having been passed by one House, has not been passed by the other House with amendments and returned to the House in which it originated, no amendment shall be proposed to the Bill other than such amendments (if any) as are made necessary by the delay in the passage of the Bill;
 (b) if the Bill has been so passed and returned, only such amendments as aforesaid shall be proposed to the Bill and such other amendments as are relevant to the matters with respect to which the Houses have not agreed; and the decision of the person presiding as to the amendments which are admissible under this clause shall be final
 (5) A joint sitting may be held under this article and a Bill passed thereat, notwithstanding that a dissolution of the House of the People has intervened since the President notified his intention to summon the Houses to meet therein",Article 108: Joint Sitting of Both Houses in Certain Cases,"This article deals with a situation where both Houses of Parliament (the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha) are unable to agree on a Bill. In such cases, the President can call a Joint Sitting of both Houses to resolve the disagreement.

Clause 1: When a Joint Sitting Can Be Called
If a Bill has been passed by one House and sent to the other, and:
The Bill is rejected by the other House.
The two Houses cannot agree on amendments to the Bill.
More than six months pass after the Bill is sent to the other House, and that House has not passed the Bill.
In such situations, the President can decide to call a Joint Sitting of both Houses for discussion and voting on the Bill.
However, Money Bills (related to money, taxes, or government spending) are not included in this process.
Clause 2: Counting of Six Months
When counting the six months mentioned in Clause 1, you don’t count the time when the House is prorogued (temporarily closed) or adjourned for more than four consecutive days.
Clause 3: Procedure After the President’s Notification
If the President has decided to summon both Houses for a Joint Sitting, neither House can continue working on the Bill. Once the President makes this notification, they must wait for a Joint Sitting to take place.
The President can call the Joint Sitting at any time after notifying, and when the Houses meet, they will discuss and vote on the Bill.
Clause 4: Voting in the Joint Sitting
In the Joint Sitting, the Bill will be considered, and if a majority of the total members present and voting agree on the Bill (with or without amendments), the Bill is considered passed by both Houses.
Amendments to the Bill can be made during the Joint Sitting, but only under certain conditions:
If the Bill has passed in one House and not passed in the other House, the only changes that can be made are those necessary due to the delay in the Bill’s passage.
If the Bill has been passed and returned by the second House, only those amendments are allowed that relate to the disagreements between the Houses.
The decision on what amendments are allowed during this process is final and made by the presiding officer (the person leading the Joint Sitting).
Clause 5: Joint Sitting Despite Dissolution of Lok Sabha
A Joint Sitting can still take place even if the Lok Sabha is dissolved (ended before the session is over) after the President has decided to call the Joint Sitting.
In this case, the President’s notification still stands, and the Joint Sitting can proceed even after the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.
In simple terms:
When to Call a Joint Sitting: If the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha can’t agree on a Bill for various reasons (rejection, disagreements on changes, or delay), the President can call a Joint Sitting of both Houses to settle the matter.
Six-Month Rule: If the Bill is stuck for six months in one House, the President can step in, but time spent in prorogation or long adjournments isn’t counted.
Waiting for Joint Sitting: After the President’s decision, both Houses must wait for the Joint Sitting to discuss and vote on the Bill.
How the Bill is Passed: If most members of both Houses agree to the Bill in the Joint Sitting, it’s considered passed. The rules on amendments depend on whether the Bill has been passed in both Houses before or not.
Joint Sitting Despite Lok Sabha's Dissolution: If the Lok Sabha is dissolved, the Joint Sitting can still take place as long as the President has already decided to call it."
109,"109. Special procedure in respect of Money Bills
 (1) A Money Bill shall not be introduced in the Council of States
 (2) After a Money Bill has been passed by the House of the People it shall be transmitted to the Council of States for its recommendations and the Council of States shall within a period of fourteen days from the date of its receipt of the Bill return the Bill to the house of the People with its recommendations and the House of the People may thereupon either accept or reject all or any of the recommendations of the Council of States
 (3) If the House of the People accepts any of the recommendations of the council of States, the Money Bill shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses with the amendments recommended by the council of States and accepted by the House of the People
 (4) If the House of the People does not accept any of the recommendations of the council of States, the Money Bill shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses in the form in which it was passed by the House of the People without any of the amendments recommended by the Council of States
 (5) If a Money Bill passed by the House of the People and transmitted to the council of States for its recommendations is not returned to the House of the People within the said period of fourteen days, it shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses at the expiration of the said period in the form in which it was passed by the House of the People",Article 109: Special Procedure in Respect of Money Bills,"This article sets out the special procedure for the passage of Money Bills through Parliament, outlining how the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) deal with such Bills.

Clause 1: Where a Money Bill Can Be Introduced
A Money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (House of the People).
It cannot be introduced in the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).
Clause 2: Sending a Money Bill to the Rajya Sabha
Once the Lok Sabha passes a Money Bill, it is sent to the Rajya Sabha for its recommendations.
The Rajya Sabha has 14 days to consider the Bill and send it back to the Lok Sabha with its recommendations.
The Rajya Sabha is required to act quickly within 14 days from receiving the Bill.
Clause 3: Accepting the Recommendations of the Rajya Sabha
If the Lok Sabha agrees to any of the recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha, the Money Bill will be passed by both Houses with the changes suggested by the Rajya Sabha that the Lok Sabha accepts.
Essentially, the Lok Sabha can accept or reject the changes the Rajya Sabha proposes, and the Bill becomes law with the agreed-upon amendments.
Clause 4: Rejecting the Recommendations of the Rajya Sabha
If the Lok Sabha rejects all the recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha, the Money Bill will be considered passed by both Houses in the exact form in which it was originally passed by the Lok Sabha.
In this case, the Rajya Sabha's recommendations are ignored, and the Bill is deemed passed without any changes.
Clause 5: Rajya Sabha Failing to Return the Bill
If the Rajya Sabha does not return the Money Bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days (for any reason), the Bill is considered to be passed by both Houses in the form in which it was originally passed by the Lok Sabha.
This means that if the Rajya Sabha delays or does not act on a Money Bill, the Lok Sabha’s version of the Bill automatically becomes the final version after 14 days.
In simple terms:
Money Bills can only start in the Lok Sabha and not the Rajya Sabha.
After the Lok Sabha passes a Money Bill, the Rajya Sabha has 14 days to suggest changes (recommendations).
If the Lok Sabha agrees to any of those changes, the Money Bill is passed with those changes.
If the Lok Sabha rejects all the suggestions, the Bill passes in the form it was passed by the Lok Sabha.
If the Rajya Sabha does not act within 14 days, the Bill is automatically considered passed in the form it was passed by the Lok Sabha."

Clause 1: Presentation of the Annual Financial Statement
The President has to present a statement each year to both Houses of Parliament (the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha) showing the estimated receipts (income) and expenditure (spending) of the Government of India for the upcoming financial year.
This statement is referred to as the ""Annual Financial Statement"" (the Budget).
Clause 2: Breakdown of the Expenditure
The statement will show the estimated expenditure in two categories:
(a) Expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India: This is a special category of expenditure that is automatically paid from the government's main account (Consolidated Fund) without needing Parliament’s approval each year.
(b) Other expenditure: This is the regular expenditure that requires Parliament’s approval.
Additionally, the statement must clearly show:
Expenditure on revenue account: This is for the day-to-day running of the government.
Other types of expenditure: This includes things like investments or capital expenses.
Clause 3: Expenditure Charged on the Consolidated Fund of India
Some expenditures are automatically paid from the Consolidated Fund of India and do not require annual approval from Parliament. These include:

(a) The President's emoluments: The salary, allowances, and office expenses related to the President's office.

 (1) So much of the estimates as relates to expenditure charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India shall not be submitted to the vote of Parliament, but nothing in this clause shall be construed as preventing the discussion in either House of Parliament of any of those estimates
 (2) So much of the said estimates as relates to other expenditure shall be submitted in the form of demands for grants to the House of the People, and the House of the People shall have power to assent, or to refuse to assent, to any demand, or to assent to any demand subject to a reduction of the amount specified therein
 (3) No demand for a grant shall be made except on the recommendation of the President",Article 113: Procedure in Parliament with Respect to Estimates,"Article 113 of the Indian Constitution outlines the process for approving government expenditure and the procedure that Parliament follows with respect to the estimates of expenditure presented in the Annual Financial Statement (the Union Budget).

Clause 1: Expenditure Charged on the Consolidated Fund of India
The estimates for expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India (such as debt charges, salaries of the President, salaries of judges, etc.) are not voted on by Parliament.
However, discussion on these estimates is allowed in both Houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha).
In simple terms, while Parliament cannot vote to approve or reject these charges (as they are automatically paid), debate on them is still permitted.
Clause 2: Other Expenditure
The estimates for other expenditure (expenses that are not automatically charged on the Consolidated Fund) are presented as demands for grants to the Lok Sabha (House of the People).
Demands for grants refer to the specific requests made by the government for funding particular projects or activities.
The Lok Sabha has the power to:
Approve the demand for the full amount.
Reject the demand entirely.
Approve the demand but with a reduction in the amount requested.
This gives the Lok Sabha significant control over the allocation of funds for government programs.
Clause 3: Presidential Recommendation for Grants
A demand for a grant (a request for funds) cannot be made unless it is recommended by the President.
This ensures that the President has formal approval over the government’s request for funding before Parliament considers it."
114,"114. Appropriation Bills
 (1) As soon as may be after the grants under article 113 have been made by the House of the People, there shall be introduced a Bill to provide for the appropriation out of the Consolidated Fund of India of all moneys required to meet
 (a) the grants so made by the House of the People; and
 (b) the expenditure charged on the Consolidated fund of India but not exceeding in any case the amount shown in the statement previously laid before Parliament
 (2) No amendment shall be proposed to any such Bill in either House of Parliament which will have the effect of varying the amount or altering the destination of any grant so made or of varying the amount of any expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, and the decision of the person presiding as to whether an amendment is inadmissible under this clause shall be final
 (3) Subject to the provisions of articles 115 and 116, no money shall be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India expect under appropriation made by law passed in accordance with the provisions of this article",Article 114: Appropriation Bills,"Article 114 of the Indian Constitution deals with the Appropriation Bill, which is a legal requirement for the government to access funds from the Consolidated Fund of India. It ensures that money can only be withdrawn for government spending if it is legally authorized through an appropriation process.

Clause 1: Introduction of the Appropriation Bill
Once grants (approved by the Lok Sabha, as per Article 113) are made, the Appropriation Bill is introduced. This Bill authorizes the government to withdraw money from the Consolidated Fund of India.
The purpose of the Bill is to:
Appropriate the grants already approved by the Lok Sabha (for specific projects or spending).
Appropriate the expenditure that is automatically charged on the Consolidated Fund of India (such as debt repayment or judicial salaries), but within the limits already set in the Annual Financial Statement (the Budget).
Example: If the Lok Sabha has approved a grant for education, the Appropriation Bill ensures that the money can be withdrawn from the fund to fulfill this purpose.
Clause 2: Restrictions on Amendments to the Bill
When the Appropriation Bill is discussed in Parliament, no amendments can be made that:
Increase or decrease the amount of the grants already approved.
Change the purpose (destination) of any approved grants or expenditure.
The Presiding officer (Speaker of the Lok Sabha or Chairman of the Rajya Sabha) will decide if any proposed amendment violates this rule. Their decision is final.
Clause 3: Legal Requirement for Withdrawal of Funds
No money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India unless it is appropriated by law passed through the Appropriation Bill.
This ensures that government spending is legally authorized and that Parliament has the final say on how funds are spent."
115,"115. Supplementary, additional or excess grants
 (1) The President shall
 (a) If the amount authorised by any law made in accordance with the provisions of article 114 to be expended for a particular service for the current financial year is found to be insufficient for the purposes of that year or when a need has arisenduring the current financial year for supplementary or additional expenditure upon some new service not contemplated in the annual financial statement for that year, or
 (b) if any money has been spent on any service during a financial year in excess of the amount granted for that service and for that year, cause to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament another statement showing the estimated amount of that expenditure or cause to be presented to the House of the People a demand for such excess, as the case may be
 (2) The provisions of articles 112, 113 and 114 shall have effect in relation to any such statement and expenditure or demand and also to any law to be made authorising the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India to meet such expenditure or the grant in respect of such demand as they have effect in relation to the annual financial statement and the expenditure mentioned therein or to a demand for a grant and the law to be made for the authorisation of appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India to meet such expenditure or grant","Article 115 - Supplementary, Additional, or Excess Grants","
If the government needs more funds than initially allocated in the Budget, it can ask Parliament for Supplementary Grants to cover the extra expenses.
Article 115: Supplementary, Additional, or Excess Grants
Article 115 of the Indian Constitution provides a process for the government to request additional funds during the financial year if the initial allocation is insufficient or if extra expenses arise. It ensures that Parliament has control over how the government's budget is adjusted.

Clause 1: Circumstances for Additional Grants
The President, if the following situations arise, will submit a request to Parliament for supplementary, additional, or excess grants:

(a) If the funds authorized for a particular service (as per the Appropriation Bill) are found to be insufficient for the current financial year.
For example, if a project faces unforeseen costs or the government needs extra funds for a service, such as healthcare during a pandemic.
(b) If the government spends more than the approved budget on a service during the year.
For instance, if the government has already exceeded the initially allocated funds for a department, it will need extra authorization from Parliament to cover the excess expenditure.
In either case, the President will:

Lay before Parliament a statement showing the additional amount of expenditure required.
Alternatively, a demand will be made in the Lok Sabha for the excess amount that has been spent.
Clause 2: Procedural Application
The process for obtaining these supplementary, additional, or excess grants follows the same procedures as the Annual Financial Statement (Article 112), Demands for Grants (Article 113), and the Appropriation Bill (Article 114).
This means that Parliament will review and approve the additional expenditure just as it would the regular budget.
The process involves:
Discussing and approving the extra funds.
Introducing a law for the appropriation (withdrawal) of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India to meet the new expenditure."
116,"116. Votes on account, votes of credit and exceptional grants
 (1) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Chapter, the House of the People shall have power
 (a) to make any grant in advance in respect of the estimated expenditure for a part of any financial year pending the completion of the procedure prescribed in article 113 for the voting of such grant and the passing of the law in accordance with the provisions of article 114 in relation to that expenditure;
 (b) to make a grant for meeting an unexpected demand upon there sources of India when on account of the magnitude or the indefinite character of the service the demand cannot be stand with the details ordinarily given in an annual financial statement;
 (c) to make an exceptional grant which forms no part of the current service of any financial year; and Parliament shall have power to authorise by law the withdrawal of moneys from the Consolidated Fund of India for the purposes for which the said grants are made
 (2) The provisions of articles 113 and 114 shall have effect in relation to the making of any grant under clause ( 1 ) and to any law to be made under that clause as they have effect in relation to the making of a grant with regard to any expenditure mentioned in the annual financial statement and the law to be made for the authorisation of appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India to meet such expenditure","Article 116: Votes on Account, Votes of Credit, and Exceptional Grants","This article addresses the need for the government to make advance or emergency funding requests in situations where regular budget approval processes cannot be completed on time. It allows the government to access funds when there are urgent or unforeseen expenses.

Clause 1: Powers of the House of the People
The House of the People (Lok Sabha) is empowered to make certain kinds of grants in specific situations, even before the formal approval processes (as outlined in Articles 113 and 114) are completed:

Grant in Advance (Votes on Account)

The House can approve a temporary grant for part of a financial year while the full budget approval process is still pending.
This ensures that essential government functions can continue smoothly without waiting for the full passage of the budget.
Example: If the new budget is delayed but the government needs funds for ongoing services like salaries or infrastructure, the House can approve a vote on account to meet these needs.
Grant for Unexpected Demand (Votes of Credit)

In cases where there is an unexpected financial emergency, such as a natural disaster or a national security crisis, the House can approve funds even if the exact details of the expenditure are unclear or too large to fit within the normal budget process.
Example: If a sudden, large-scale natural disaster requires immediate relief, the House may approve an emergency fund (votes of credit) without needing detailed breakdowns.
Exceptional Grant

The House can approve a one-time exceptional grant that is not part of the regular, recurring expenses of the government for that financial year.
Example: A special grant for a major infrastructure project or an unforeseen expenditure that does not fit into the annual budget.
In each of these cases, Parliament is authorized to make laws for the withdrawal of money from the Consolidated Fund of India to cover these grants.

Clause 2: Procedure for Making Grants
Even though these grants are made under exceptional circumstances, the provisions of Articles 113 and 114 (which outline the procedure for voting on grants and appropriating funds) still apply. This means:

The grants must be reviewed, debated, and passed by the House.
Laws to authorize the appropriation of money from the Consolidated Fund of India must be made according to the procedures outlined in the Constitution, ensuring proper checks and balances."
117,"117. Special provisions as to financial Bills
 (1) A Bill or amendment making provision for any of the matters specified in sub clauses (a) to (f) of clause ( 1 ) of article 110 shall not be introduced or moved except on the recommendation of the President and a Bill making such provision shall not be introduced in the Council of States: Provided that no recommendation shall be required under this clause for the moving of an amendment making provision for the reduction or abolition of any tax
 (2) A Bill or amendment shall not be deemed to make provision for any of the matters aforesaid by reason only that it provides for the imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment of fees for licences or fees for services rendered, or by reason that it provides for the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes
 (3) A Bill which, if enacted and brought into operation, would involve expenditure from the consolidated Fund of India shall not be passed by either House of Parliament unless the President has recommended to that House the consideration of the Bill Procedure Generally",Article 117 - Special Provisions as to Financial Bills,"
Money Bills (those related to taxes, loans, and expenditure) can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha (Lower House) with the President's recommendation.
Article 117: Special Provisions as to Financial Bills
This article lays down specific rules for financial bills in the Indian Parliament, particularly with regard to the approval of expenditures from the Consolidated Fund of India and the recommendation of the President.

Clause 1: Restrictions on the Introduction of Certain Financial Bills
Presidential Recommendation Required

A financial bill (or an amendment to a bill) that deals with matters listed in Article 110, Clause 1(a) to (f) (related to the imposition, regulation, and spending of taxes, or borrowing of money) cannot be introduced or moved in Parliament without the recommendation of the President.
This ensures that financial matters, particularly those that directly impact government revenue and expenditure, are introduced with the President's prior approval, which represents the executive branch’s consent.
A financial bill with such provisions cannot be introduced in the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) either. It must start in the House of the People (Lok Sabha).
Exceptions for Certain Amendments

The clause makes an exception: No Presidential recommendation is needed for moving an amendment to a bill if the amendment reduces or abolishes a tax. This allows Parliament to discuss and pass amendments that aim to reduce taxes without needing prior approval from the President.
Clause 2: What Does Not Count as a Financial Bill
A bill or amendment that introduces provisions for penalties, fines, fees for licenses, or taxes imposed by local authorities (for local purposes) does not count as a financial bill, even if it touches on taxes or fees.
Essentially, the clause clarifies that local taxes or fees for services (e.g., licensing fees) imposed by local authorities do not make a bill subject to the special provisions for financial bills, meaning these bills can proceed with fewer restrictions.
Clause 3: Recommendation for Bills Involving Expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India
If a bill involves expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India (i.e., it requires the government to spend money from the central fund), it cannot be passed by either House of Parliament unless the President has recommended the consideration of the bill.
This ensures that any spending from the Consolidated Fund is authorized by the executive (the President) before Parliament discusses or approves it."
118,"118. Rules of procedure
 (1) Each House of Parliament may make rules for regulations, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, its procedure and the conduct of its business
 (2) Until rules are made under clause ( 1 ), the rules of procedure and standing orders in force immediately before the commencement of this Constitution with respect to the Legislature of the Dominion of India shall have effect in relation to Parliament subject to such modifications and adaptations as may be made therein by the Chairman of the Council of States or the Speaker of the House of the People, as the case may be
 (3) The President, after consultation with the Chairman of the Council of States and the Speaker of the House of the People, may make rules as to the procedure with respect to joint sittings of, and communications between, the two Houses
 (4) At a joint sitting of the two Houses the Speaker of the House of the People, or in his absence such person as may be determined by rules of procedure made under clause ( 3 ), shall preside",Article 118: Rules of Procedure,"This article gives Parliament the authority to make its own rules regarding how it conducts its business, regulates its procedures, and handles joint sittings between the two Houses. It also lays down specific provisions regarding the rules for joint sittings and the presiding officer at such sittings.

Clause 1: Rules for Procedure and Conduct of Business
Each House of Parliament (i.e., the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) has the power to make its own rules for the procedure and conduct of its business, as long as these rules do not contradict the Constitution.
These rules can cover the organization of debates, voting procedures, motions, questioning, and other aspects of parliamentary functioning.
Clause 2: Interim Rules
Interim rules: If a House has not yet made its own rules, the rules and standing orders that were in force immediately before the Constitution came into effect (during the time of the Dominion of India) will still apply. However, these can be modified or adapted by:
The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha (Council of States), or
The Speaker of the Lok Sabha (House of the People).
This clause ensures that there is no vacuum in the parliamentary procedures during the transition period, and business can still be conducted as per the previous rules.
Clause 3: Rules for Joint Sittings and Communication Between Houses
The President of India has the authority, after consulting both the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, to make rules for joint sittings of the two Houses and for the communication between the Houses.
This is particularly important for matters like joint discussions or voting on issues that require the approval of both Houses together (e.g., in cases where both Houses cannot agree on a Bill, they may meet in a joint session).
The rules would help in coordination and smooth functioning of joint sittings.
Clause 4: Presiding Officer at Joint Sitting
At a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha will preside over the session. If the Speaker is absent, then the person who has been designated by the rules of procedure made under clause (3) will preside instead."

122,"122. Courts not to inquire into proceedings of Parliament
 (1) The validity of any proceedings in Parliament shall not be called in question on the ground of any alleged irregularity of procedure
 (2) No officer or member of Parliament in whom powers are vested by or under this Constitution for regulating procedure or the conduct of business, or for maintaining order, in Parliament shall be subject to the jurisdiction of any court in respect of the exercise by him of those powers CHAPTER III LEGISLATIVE POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT",Article 122 - Courts Not to Inquire into Proceedings of Parliament,"The courts cannot question or interfere in the proceedings of Parliament, even if the procedure followed by Parliament was irregular.

An Ordinance is a temporary law made by the President, and it has the same effect as an Act of Parliament but with specific limitations.

Clause 1: Conditions for Promulgating an Ordinance
When both Houses of Parliament are not in session, and the President believes that urgent action is required due to certain circumstances, he can promulgate an Ordinance.
This power allows the President to make laws during a recess (when Parliament is not in session) when a delay in legislation could be detrimental or harmful.
The President can take action based on the situation and needs of the moment, even if Parliament is not available to discuss or pass a Bill.
Clause 2: Characteristics of the Ordinance
Force and effect: An Ordinance has the same power and legal effect as an Act of Parliament (a law passed by Parliament).

However, it is not permanent. It will automatically cease to have effect under the following conditions:

Six weeks after Parliament reconvenes, unless Parliament approves it before then.
Resolutions disapproving the Ordinance: If both Houses of Parliament pass resolutions rejecting the Ordinance, it will cease to have effect once the second resolution is passed.
Power to withdraw: The President can also withdraw the Ordinance at any time, even before the six-week period ends.

Explanation: If Parliament is reconvened on different dates, the six-week period is calculated from the later date of the two reconvening dates.

Clause 3: Restrictions on Ordinances
An Ordinance cannot make laws that Parliament would not be competent to enact under the Constitution. If it does, such a provision in the Ordinance will be void (invalid).
For example, if the Ordinance violates any constitutional limitations or exceeds the powers granted to Parliament, it will be considered null and void.
