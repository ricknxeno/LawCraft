 (2) The provisions of articles 203 and 204 shall have effect in relation to the making of any grant under clause ( 1 ) and to any law to be made under that clause as they have effect in relation to the making of a grant with regard to any expenditure mentioned in the annual financial statement and the law to be made for the authorisation of appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of the State to meet such expenditure","Article 206: Votes on Account, Votes of Credit, and Exceptional Grants","This article provides the Legislative Assembly of a State with the power to approve certain types of grants in exceptional circumstances.

(1) Types of Grants:
The Legislative Assembly of a State has the authority to make the following types of grants:

(a) Grant in Advance (Votes on Account):
The Assembly can approve a temporary grant for part of the financial year before the full financial procedures (as described in Article 203) are completed. This is used to ensure the government can function while waiting for the final budget approval.
(b) Grant for Unexpected Demands (Votes of Credit):
If an unexpected demand arises that cannot be predicted in the annual financial statement due to its magnitude or indefinite nature, the Assembly can approve a grant to meet this unforeseen expenditure.
This is generally for emergencies or large-scale unforeseen needs that cannot be included in the normal budgeting process.
(c) Exceptional Grant:
The Assembly can make a grant for special circumstances that don't fall under regular yearly expenditure. These are grants that do not form part of the current service of the year but are necessary for certain extraordinary needs.
In all these cases, the Legislature of the State can pass laws authorizing the withdrawal of money from the Consolidated Fund of the State for these specific grants.

(2) Applicability of Articles 203 and 204:
The provisions of Articles 203 (Estimates and approval of expenditure) and 204 (Appropriation Bill) still apply to any grants made under Article 206(1). This means the process for authorizing the expenditure and appropriation of funds from the Consolidated Fund remains the same as for the regular annual financial grants."

 (1) A Bill or amendment making provision for any of the matters specified in sub clause (a) to (f) of clause ( 1 ) of article 199 shall not be introduced or moved except on the recommendation of the Governor, and a Bill making such provision shall not be introduced in a Legislative Council: Provided that no recommendation shall be required under this clause for the moving of an amendment making provision for the reduction or abolition of any tax
 (2) A Bill or amendment shall not be deemed to make provision for any of the matters aforesaid by reason only that it provides for the imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment of fees for licences or fees for services rendered, or by reason that it provides for the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes
 (3) A Bill which, if enacted and brought into operation, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of a State shall not be passed by a House of the Legislature of the State unless the Governor has recommended to that House the consideration of the Bill Procedure Generally",Article 207: Special Provisions as to Financial Bills,"This article deals with specific procedures related to Financial Bills in the State Legislature.

(1) Introduction of Financial Bills:
A Financial Bill (or an amendment to a Bill) that deals with certain financial matters (as specified in Article 199) can only be introduced on the recommendation of the Governor.
The matters specified in Article 199 include areas such as taxes, borrowing money, custody of funds, appropriation of money, and financial obligations of the State.
Prohibition on Introduction in the Legislative Council:
Such a Financial Bill cannot be introduced in the Legislative Council. It must originate in the Legislative Assembly.
Exception for Amendment of Taxes:
No recommendation from the Governor is required for an amendment that proposes to reduce or abolish any tax. This is an exception to the rule that requires the Governor's recommendation.
(2) Financial Bills Definition:
A Bill or amendment shall not be considered a Financial Bill solely because it imposes fines, penalties, or fees. It also does not become a Financial Bill just because it relates to the imposition or regulation of taxes by a local authority for local purposes (such as taxes levied for municipal services).
(3) Recommendation by the Governor for Financial Expenditure:
A Bill that requires expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of the State (the State's primary financial resource) cannot be passed by any House of the State Legislature unless the Governor has recommended that the Bill be considered.
This ensures that financial matters requiring the allocation of funds are controlled and recommended by the Governor before the Legislature takes them up."
